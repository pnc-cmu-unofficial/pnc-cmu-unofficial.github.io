I"¸<p><strong>June 2020</strong>: I am happy to share that the inaugural unofficial PNC coursework guide is now available below. This is a coursework roadmap for students on the Joint Ph.D. track in Neural Computation and Machine Learning at CMU. It is written for students in early stages of coursework. The roadmap aggregates insights from over a dozen PNC students about coursework combinations and sequencing of pre-requisites, all with the goal of minimizing stress and maximizing research productivity. Students who have completed coursework contributed their stories about good coursework choices as well as avoidable and painful mistakes, with the hope that future students can benefit.</p>
